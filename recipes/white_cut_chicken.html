        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            White cut chicken is a simple poached chicken that is deceptively tasty!<br>
            The leftover poaching liquid can then be reused as chicken stock and incorporated into many other dishes!
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Whole chicken</li>
            <li>3 stalks of scallion (a.k.a. spring onion/green onion)</li>
            <li>Thumb-size piece of ginger (peeled and bruised, or sliced)</li>
            <li>1 tbsp salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil enough water in a pot large enough to fully submerge a whole chicken (if you do not have a large enough pot, feel free to cut the chicken into whatever size fits).</li>
            <li>Add the salt, scallion and ginger to the water and keep at a rolling boil.</li>
            <li>Carefully submerge the chicken in the boiling water, dipping in and out to make sure the cavity is filled with boiling water (otherwise it will not cook evenly).</li>
            <li>Poach the chicken for at least 45 minutes or until the chicken is fully cooked through.</li>
            <li>Remove the chicken and plunge into an ice bath to stop the cooking process and keep the chicken smooth - leave in the ice bath for at least 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove the chicken, pat dry and chop/shred however you desire! Best served cold with <a href="ginger_scallion_oil.html">ginger scallion oil</a>!</li>
        </ol>
