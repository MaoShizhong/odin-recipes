        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>
            Foo Yung (a.k.a. Cantonese scrambled eggs) is a classic dish that is very simple to make! It is incredibly versatile so can be made as simple or complex as you like, whatever you feel like/have at home!<br>
            This version will use king prawns. I recommend larger prawns where possible and if they are not already, you should peel and de-vein them.
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Handful of prawns (peels and de-veined)</li>
            <li>4 large eggs</li>
            <li>Half stalk scallion - roughly chopped</li>
            <li>2 tbsp oil</li>
            <li>Pinch of salt</li>
            <li>Pinch of white pepper</li>
            <li>1 tsp Cornstarch</li>
            <li>Pinch of sugar</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Dry and marinate the prawns with a pinch of salt, white pepper and the cornstarch. Leave for at least 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Roughly chop the scallion and add to a bowl of 4 beaten eggs. Add a dash of oil, salt and sugar, and mix well.</li>
            <li>In a hot wok or pan, add a little oil and fry off the prawns until there are mostly orange and around 80% cooked (approx. 40-50s depending on the size).</li>
            <li>Add the prawns into the egg mixture and mix well again.</li>
            <li>Heat the wok or pan back up and add the rest of the oil. Add the full egg mixture back (the oil should be hot enough so that the egg mixture starts bubbling immediately).</li>
            <li>Let the egg mixture sit for a few seconds before folding it in on itself with a spatula. Let each folded layer sit for a few seonds each time.</li>
            <li>When the majority of the egg is cooked (ideally you still want a little bit of runniness/gooeyness!), turn off the heat and fold a few more times to finish (the residual heat from the pan will finish everything off).</li>
            <li>Plate, serve and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
