        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>
            Ginger scallion oil - one of the simplest but most treasured sauces of Cantonese cuisine!<br>
            This sauce goes wonderfully with our <a href="white_cut_chicken.html">white-cut chicken</a> recipe, giving you the perfect blend of light and sweet with sharp and tangy.
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Scallions (approx. same amount as ginger when chopped)</li>
            <li>Ginger (approx. same amount as scallions when chopped)</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
            <li>Sand ginger powder (optional but highly recommended)</li>
            <li>Any neutral oil</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Finely chop the scallions and ginger and mix in a bowl.</li>
            <li>If you have or can get sand ginger powder (a relative of ginger/galangal which is not very spicy but much more gentle and aromatic) then add about a teaspoon and mix in well.</li>
            <li>Add salt to taste (you ideally want this a little on the salty side as adding the hot oil later will round out some of the saltiness.</li>
            <li>Heat some neutral oil (e.g. rapeseed oil) in a pan until very hot (if you dropped a small piece of the ginger/scallion mix in, it would immediately sizzle).</li>
            <li>Once hot enough, pour the hot oil over the ginger/scallion mix, then mix well with a spoon.</li>
            <li>Allow to cool before tasting and adding more salt if needed. Best served on the colder side which will add to that sharpness and tang!</li>
        </ol>
